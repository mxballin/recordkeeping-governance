## Acknowledgement of Country

This research is being conducted as part of a graduate program at Monash University, which is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded lands of the people of the Kulin Nations. I wish to pay respect to their elders past and present as well as to those of the lands from which you read this message.

Records, archives, and out of home care have all played significant roles in the traumatization and colonization of First Nations and Aboriginal communities in Australia. Keeping this in mind, and considering the fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in care overrepresented in out-of-home-care <sup> 1 </sup>, I come to the table with a desire to conduct research that is decolonial in its theoretical basis and practice.

## About the Research Team

<h6>Mya Ballin</h6>
Mya is a Chinese settler who was adopted from Jiangmen, China and brought to Turtle Island as the daughter of a single German-Jewish American mother in 1995. She grew up on the unceded territories of the Tamyen and Ramaytush Ohlone peoples in what is now called California. Mya's research interests include devising strategies of care in archival praxis, understanding personal experiences of bureaucratic recordkeeping, and the role of records in identify formation.
