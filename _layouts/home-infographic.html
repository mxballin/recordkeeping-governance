      <h1> Introduction </h1>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I am interested in considering how the creation, implementation, and assessment of recordkeeping policies and practices can imbue care into the overall processes. My objective in contributing to the <a href="https://rights-records.it.monash.edu/research-development-agenda/real-time-rights-based-recordkeeping-governance/">Real-time Rights-based Recordkeeping Governance project</a> is to help achieve a better understanding of how the design and format of documents can allow for interoperability and accountability while at the same time engendering an ethics of care. I am interested in the analytics and metrics angle of this PhD project because I think these elements of assessment are important checks and balances that can genuinely help to bring about institutional self-reflection and change.

With this in mind, I am particularly interested in pursuing research in two threads:
        
    <ol>    

<li>Considering the applications of archival diplomatics and the creation of form (genre studies) in the implementation of a collective ethics in the care of children and the translation of policy into action.</li>
<li>Exploring methods of storytelling using analysis and visualisation that effectively capture and communicate why change and/or compliance is important in the context of providing care with care.</li>
      </ol>
